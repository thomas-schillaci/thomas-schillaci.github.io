Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, I am studying Machine Learning and want to start pursuing a PhD in the field by 2021.

I started programming in 2007 and haven't been able to stop since ; from creating video games to studying Machine Learning, far is the day where I'll get bored of it.

As I said, I love creating video games, I have already participated in 4 game jams (48h to make a game *from scratch*) and I love mountain biking (did you see how happy I was on the homepage's picture?).
