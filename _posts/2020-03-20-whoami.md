Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, I am studying Machine Learning and want to pursue a PhD in the field by 2021.

I discovered programming in 2007 and haven't been able to stop since ; recently I have started studying Machine Learning, a field in which I thrive.

Besides, I love creating video games, I have already participated in 4 game jams (48h to make a game *from scratch*) and I love mountain biking (did you see how happy I am on the homepage's picture?)
