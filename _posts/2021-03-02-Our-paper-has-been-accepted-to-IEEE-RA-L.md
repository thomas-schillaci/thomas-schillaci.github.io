The first paper I contributed to has been accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.
Antoine Richard, Stephanie Aravecchia, Thomas Schillaci, Matthieu Geist, & Cedric Pradalier *How To Train Your HERON*, 2021,  is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10357">arXiv</a>.

In addition to being published in the IEEE RA-Letters, our paper will be presented at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in 2021.

My contribution consists of the state of the art in Reinforcement Learning, the related works in perception-based control, and the choice and justification of our agent (Dreamer) in the context of our research.
