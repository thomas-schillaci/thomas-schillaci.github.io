Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a specialization in Machine Learning, I am looking for professional opportunities starting in May 2021.

I started programming in 2007 and haven't been able to stop since ; from creating video games to conducting research in Machine Learning, far is the day when I'll get bored of it.

My love for mathematics as well as my passion for programming has led me to study Computer Science, and I have discovered a profound interest in the field of Machine Learning.

I love creating video games, I have already participated in 4 game jams (48h to make a game *from scratch*) and I love mountain biking (did you see the homepage's picture?).
