When I was in high school, Richard Feynman was only a famous scientist whose work was too complicated for me to grasp.
This was the case until I discovered [his physics lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) and soon after a few books about his life.

Today, Richard Feynman is one of the people who has had a lot of influence on my educational background.\
He has a way to create representations of concepts to structure his reasoning that makes his explanations so clear, that I hope one day I will be able to create content with this level of quality.

With that in mind, I think you can imagine how I felt when a company offered me an intership where I would have had to create courses on a topic I loved.

## My internship at Hardis Group

Hardis Group is a french software firm that employs 1'000+ people for a turnover of â‚¬115M+ in 2018.

My internship topic had two perspectives: full stack development and Machine Learning courses creation, I talk briefly about the first one before reflecting about the big one.
